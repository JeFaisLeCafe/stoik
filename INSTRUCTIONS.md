# JS Full-Stack Engineer — Technical Test

## Introduction

We want you to build a **URL shortener** service. The application can be used to turn a long link into a shorter one (e.g.  
`https://www.stoik.com/barometre-ifop-2025-eti-risque-cyber` → `https://localhost/ABC123`) that **redirects** to the original URL.

It looks simple, but it quickly raises real-world questions around reliability, security, data modeling, and scalability.

Your goal is to build a **simple, clean, working** version that we’ll review together during the interview.

> **Important:** please **send us your project via a GitHub repository link** _before_ the interview.  
> Make sure your full stack is **ready and running locally** for the interview, as we’ll review the application together.

## Technical must-haves

### Frontend

- **React** + **TypeScript**
- A single, straightforward form to shorten a valid URL
- A clean and pleasant **UI/UX** (simple is fine, but it should feel polished)

### Backend

- **Node** + **TypeScript**
- You may use the framework of your choice (Express, NestJS, etc.)
- At least **one API endpoint** to shorten a URL
- Working redirection from short URLs
- A **SQL database** (PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)

### General

- A **README.md** explaining:
  - How to run the project locally
  - Your main technical choices
  - Any assumptions or shortcuts
- The project should be easy for someone else to install and run
- No need to host the application

## Bonus features

Totally optional. If you add extras, focus on things that make sense from a product or technical point of view, rather than sheer complexity.

---

## What we’ll look at during the interview

- A working stack (frontend, backend, database) that we can run together
- Clear explanations of your decisions, trade-offs, and next steps
- A **product-oriented** implementation, including user experience
- Your thinking around **scaling**, **security**, and production readiness
- Code quality and general technical best practices

## Note about using AI

Using AI tools is totally fine (Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.).

- Review everything you use
- Be able to **explain all the code**
- Treat AI as an assistant, not a black box

Transparency about AI usage is appreciated.

## Final notes

- Keep things **simple**, but **correct**
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- There’s no single “right” solution — we care about your reasoning

We’re looking forward to discussing your implementation with you!
